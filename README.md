## Design

Our website embraces a minimalist black and white design philosophy, creating a sophisticated and professional aesthetic that reflects our commitment to quality. The design system is built on the following principles:

### Visual Design
The website features a clean, modern interface with a striking black and white color scheme. We use high contrast to ensure readability and accessibility, while maintaining visual hierarchy through careful typography and spacing. The design incorporates subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience without compromising performance.

### User Interface
The interface is designed with user experience at its core. We've implemented a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens. Navigation is intuitive and straightforward, with clear call-to-action buttons and consistent design patterns throughout the site.

Interactive elements are carefully crafted to provide feedback and enhance engagement. From hover effects on service cards to smooth transitions in the project gallery, each interaction is designed to feel natural and purposeful. The design maintains a professional tone while incorporating modern web design trends.
